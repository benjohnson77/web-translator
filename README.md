# Translator

Simple project to build a web translator to compare different translation API's. For a first version I wrote a simple pig latin translator. 

## Pig Latin
1. takes the frist non vowel letter and places it on the end of the word with "ay" then added. 
2. treats vowels (a,e,i,o,u) however maintains the case of the first letter, and the vowels.
3. ignores puctuation.
